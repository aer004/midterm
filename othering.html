            In the West today, it is regularly common to consume and engage with two forms of media: Kpop and Anime. On twitter,
            especially with kpop, you see Western users create fan accounts, art, and edits of their favorite idol.

            However, with this increased consumption, has come a worrying trend: a consumption of an image of asianess,
            completely disconnected from the reality of asian people and culture.
            For example, this
            <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zolotareva_tt/video/6880131913852521730?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id7070174008074864170">
            one Russian woman</a> traveled to Asia to get with a man to have an idealized version of
            an asian baby, using images of Asian babies on Pinterest to show her want
            for this baby, in the same way someone would show a Pinterest board of clothes they want to buy.

            The prevelance of kpop also increased a behavior of analyzing Korean people and celebraties and making statements
            about Korea from a complete outsider, and uneducated perspective.

            For example, when BTS member Suga released a song using a sample of a Jim Jones speach, he was met with backlash from both Western and Korean audiences.</a>
            But, there were some that choose to engage online to defend the artist, almost to the point that belittled his agency,
            and reduced him to a doll for those twitter users to consume. This tweet below shows this behavior.

            The most extreme example of this is the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Sun_scandal">Burning Sun</a>
            case, where an idol was found guilty of taking part in many
            sex crimes, including taking unconsenting videos of women.
            Many people, understandbly, were quick to not consume any of his music. However,
            some fans (particulary non-Korean people), decieded to use social media to help defend his actions
            and try to help protect his image.

            With the increase of Asian media in the Western media diet, people need to understand the separation between them
            and the asian culture they are consuming. Simply because they are a fan of the media, does not mean that this provides them
            deep understanding of the cultures they are consuming. Moreover, there seems to be an unwillingness to actually learn about
            foriegn culture beyond the shallow understand that you get from social media. This is because consuming kpop and anime is about
            the pleasure of the consumer than a respectful exchange.
