          In 1875, the United States government passed the Page Act;
          the law
          <a href="https://immigrationhistory.org/item/page-act/">“was an early effort to
          restrict Asian immigration without
          categorically restricting Asian immigration on the basis of race and
          instead restricted select categories of persons whose labor was
          perceived as immoral or coerced.”</a>
          Think Trump Muslim Ban,
          which isn’t ‘really’ a muslim ban because it also banned North Koreans.
          What this act started for the formalization of the stereotype that
          connects Asian women and prostestution.

            This stereotype blended both the sexual ‘loseness’ associated with ‘immorality’, as well as a passive nature,
            which created an image of Asian women being inherently sexual, and always willing.
            Film scholar Celine Parreñas Shimizu explains it as:
            <a href="https://www.vox.com/22338807/asian-fetish-racism-atlanta-shooting">“this construction of
              a being for others, and a being for the white man, usually, that were in these drawings and
              films and other cultural materials.”</a>
            <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/here-s-how-pop-culture-has-perpetuated-harmful-stereotypes-asian-t213676">
              These works include the likes of Full Metal Jacket,
              Memoirs of a Geisha, Miss Saigon, and even Mean Girls.</a>
              Asian women in all these movies are
              sexual to the point that they seem to have no other desires, no other motives. They exist for the
              benefits of others.

            What this leads to is situations like the shooting at the Gold Spa in Atlanta.
            The shooter, a 21-year-old whtie man, went into a spa, and killed eight people.
            Of those eight, six of them were Asian women, and were the
            <a href="https://www.vox.com/22338807/asian-fetish-racism-atlanta-shooting">
              “temptation he wanted to eliminate”</a>.
            The shooter told police that he had a sex addiction,
            and that by killing Asian women working at a spa, he could control his urges.
            In the aftermath, these stereotypes of Asian women were highlighted in the coverage of the tragedy;
            many authorities and media outlets had issues distinguishing spas from massage parlors
            (which have
            <a href="https://www.vox.com/22338807/asian-fetish-racism-atlanta-shooting">
              “a connotation of prostitution and sexualizaton”</a>).

            Besides the horrible extreme violence that Asian women can face,
            this prejudice comes to light in everyday situations: dating.
            An Asian American woman named Lillian created an
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefleshlightchronicles/">Instagram account</a>
            highlighting the messages she received from men on dating apps,
            and many of the messages include uncomfortable and demeaning comments about
            her race, and therefore her perceived sexuality
          </p>

            All of these issues, from what might seem small, to the tragedies,
            are all part of this notion that Asian women are sexual objects to consume.
